# CS-1331
Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (Java)
## Course Description
CS 1331 teaches students how to develop object-oriented solutions to computational problems. Students learn fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, basic object-oriented design principles, further develop the programming skills learned in previous courses, write medium-sized object-oriented programs in a modern programming language, and – as the first course required for computer science majors and minors – get a deeper introduction to the field of computer science.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course students will be able to define, describe and recognize examples of the principles of:

* statically typed variables;
* structured programming;
* fundamental object-oriented language features (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism);
* ad-hoc polymorphism, run-time polymorphism (subtype polymorphism) and compile-time polymorphism (generics);
* exception handling;
* event-driven programming principles as they apply to graphical user interface (GUI) programs;
* basic GUI program design;
* recursive definitions of algorithms and data structures;
* “Big-O” run time analysis of algorithms;
* basic algorithms for searching and sorting; and
* basic data structures for linked lists, stacks, and queues.

Students will also be able to write, debug and predict the behavior of programs that use these principles in programs composed of up to 20 major abstractions (e.g., classes) in up to 20 source files.
